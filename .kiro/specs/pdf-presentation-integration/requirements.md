# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate detailed PDF presentations for each platform into the interactive avatar comparison application. Users will be able to click on platform names in the appropriate comparison pages to open comprehensive PDF presentations about specific platforms (HeyGen, Soul Machines, Ravatar, D-ID) and the Microsoft vs NVIDIA comparison.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a stakeholder reviewing avatar platforms, I want to click on a clear "View Detailed Presentation" button to open the platform's detailed PDF presentation, so that I can access comprehensive information about that specific platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a "מצגת מפורטת" (Detailed Presentation) button in the SaaS comparison page THEN the system SHALL open the corresponding PDF presentation in a new tab/window
2. WHEN a user clicks on a "מצגת מפורטת" button in the Microsoft vs NVIDIA comparison page THEN the system SHALL open the Microsoft vs NVIDIA comparison PDF
3. IF a PDF file exists for a platform THEN a clear "מצגת מפורטת" button SHALL be displayed next to or below the platform information
4. WHEN a PDF is opened THEN it SHALL open in a new browser tab to avoid disrupting the main presentation flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating the presentation, I want clear and prominent "מצגת מפורטת" buttons for platforms that have detailed presentations available, so that I can easily identify and access additional information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a platform has an associated PDF THEN a prominent "מצגת מפורטת" button SHALL be displayed with clear visual styling
2. WHEN hovering over a "מצגת מפורטת" button THEN the system SHALL show hover effects and appropriate cursor changes
3. WHEN a "מצגת מפורטת" button is displayed THEN it SHALL have consistent styling across all platform cards (color, size, icon)
4. IF a platform does not have an associated PDF THEN no "מצגת מפורטת" button SHALL be displayed for that platform

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want a centralized mapping between platform names and PDF files, so that I can easily manage and update the PDF associations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load a mapping configuration between platform identifiers and PDF file paths
2. WHEN a new PDF is added THEN the developer SHALL only need to update the mapping configuration
3. WHEN a PDF file is renamed or moved THEN the system SHALL handle the path update through the mapping configuration
4. IF a PDF file is missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and log the issue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user accessing the presentation on different devices, I want the PDF opening functionality to work consistently across desktop and mobile browsers, so that I can access detailed information regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a PDF on desktop browsers THEN it SHALL open in a new tab
2. WHEN opening a PDF on mobile devices THEN it SHALL open using the device's default PDF viewer
3. WHEN a PDF fails to open THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message in Hebrew
4. WHEN the browser blocks pop-ups THEN the system SHALL provide alternative access method or clear instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a presenter using this application, I want the PDF integration to be seamless and not interfere with the main presentation flow, so that I can smoothly navigate between overview and detailed information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is opened THEN the main presentation SHALL remain in its current state
2. WHEN returning from a PDF THEN the user SHALL be on the same page they left
3. WHEN multiple PDFs are opened THEN each SHALL open in its own tab
4. WHEN the presentation is in full-screen mode THEN PDF opening SHALL not exit full-screen mode
